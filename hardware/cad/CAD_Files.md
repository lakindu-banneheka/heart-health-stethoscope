# CAD Files

This directory contains 3D design files used for the **Stethogram** digital stethoscope attachment.  
The design is based on two open-source projects:  
- **[Stethogram](https://github.com/ccteng/Stethogram.git)** – Digital stethoscope software and hardware reference.  
- **[GliaX Stethoscope](https://github.com/GliaX/Stethoscope.git)** – Open-source 3D printed stethoscope design.

## Files Included

- `mic_capped.stl`  
- `mic_capped.step`  
- `mic_insert.stl`  
- `mic_insert.step`  

These files are compatible with most 3D printers and CAD software. The `.stl` files are intended for direct printing, while the `.step` files are provided for CAD modifications.

## License

These CAD files are distributed under the same open-source licenses as the original projects.
